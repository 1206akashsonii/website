### Removed bundled legacy NUnit 2.4

Mono used to ship with a forked copy of NUnit 2.4 that we used for testing Mono itself. For historical reasons it was never updated and is ancient at this point (it was released nearly 12 years ago!).

We deprecated it in [Mono 5.0](/docs/about-mono/releases/5.0.0/#nunit) and are removing it now.

We recommend that you use a recent version of NUnit from NuGet or the project's website instead.
